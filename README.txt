This is my attempt at the challenge project for week 1 of Coursera's Intro to
Tensorflow course.

I trained a deep neural net regression model to predict the volume of a
cylinder based on 10,000 examples.

TODO:
1. Figure out why performance varies from one training session to the next.
The difference in performance can sometimes be many orders of magnitude.

2. Compare the performance of the DNN regressor to other models. 

3. Figure out what else I need to add.
